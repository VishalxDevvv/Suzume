## Level System

The bot includes a comprehensive leveling system with the following features:

- `$levelroles` - Show all configured level roles

**Slash Commands:**
- `/level [user]` - Show level card
- `/rank [user]` - Show level card
- `/leaderboard [limit]` - Show leaderboard (1-20 users)
- `/setlevelrole <level> <role>` - Set level role (Admin only)
- `/removelevelrole <level>` - Remove level role (Admin only)

## Welcome/Goodbye System

Automatic welcome and goodbye messages for new and leaving members.

### Features
- **Smart Channel Detection**: Automatically finds appropriate channels
- **Configurable Channels**: Set specific channels for welcome/goodbye messages
- **Rich Embeds**: Beautiful welcome/goodbye cards with user info

### Auto-Detection
If no specific channels are configured, the bot will automatically look for channels named:
- **Welcome**: welcome, general, lobby, main
- **Goodbye**: goodbye, farewell, general, lobby, main

### Database
- Uses SQLite for reliable data storage
- Tracks user XP, levels, message counts, and timestamps
- Stores level role configurations per server
- Stores welcome/goodbye channel settings per server
- Automatic database initialization and table creation

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Create a Discord Application

1. Go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
2. Click "New Application" and give it a name
3. Go to the "Bot" section and click "Add Bot"
4. Copy the bot token (you'll need this for the .env file)

### 2. Get Required IDs

### 4. Configure Environment Variables

Edit the `.env` file and replace the placeholder values:

```env
DISCORD_TOKEN=your_actual_bot_token_here
CLIENT_ID=your_actual_client_id_here
BOT_PREFIX=+
```

**Prefix Configuration:**
- Default prefix is `+` (e.g., `+ping`, `+help`)
- You can change it by modifying `BOT_PREFIX` in the .env file
- Examples: `!`, `?`, `>`, `$`, etc.

### 5. Bot Permissions

For a global bot with moderation features, use this invite URL template (replace CLIENT_ID):
```
https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=CLIENT_ID&permissions=1099511627775&scope=bot%20applications.commands
```

**Required Permissions for Full Functionality:**

```bash
node delete-commands.js
```

To delete guild-specific commands (requires GUILD_ID in .env):
```bash
node delete-guild-commands.js
```

**Available npm scripts:**
```bash
npm run deploy              # Deploy global commands
npm run delete-commands     # Delete all global commands
